# Smart Attendence System Using Face Recognition - Design Practicum, IIT Mandi

## Introduction

This project implements a Smart Attendance System using facial recognition technology, designed specifically for IIT Mandi. The system aims to automate the attendance tracking process, making it more efficient and accessible for both faculty and students.

Key features include:
- Centralized attendance portal accessible to all faculty and students
- Facial recognition for automated attendance marking
- Separate dashboards for faculty and students
- Comprehensive reporting and attendance management tools
- Integration with IIT Mandi's server infrastructure

The system is divided into four major components:
1. Model Specifications (using the face-recognition library)
2. Portal Design and Activation
3. Server and Database Design
4. Edge Device for Computation Optimization (Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano)

This solution minimizes cost while maximizing efficiency, providing a scalable attendance automation system for the institution.

```javascript
const dbConfig = {
  host: 'your_host',
  user: 'your_username',
  password: 'your_password',
  database: 'your_database_name'
};
```
Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials.

4. **Start the application
